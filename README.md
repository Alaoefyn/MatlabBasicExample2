# MatlabBasicExample2
Basic set of some examples written on matlab - 2


Question 1:

A brand new car loses its value at a certain rate every year. The depreciation continues as 3%, 5%, 3%, 5%... Write a MATLAB program that learns the year a car was purchased from the user via the input command and calculates how many years later this car will drop below 30% in value.

Indicate which type of loop would be more appropriate to use in solving this problem (with the reason) as a comment line at the top of your program.



Question 2:

Write a MATLAB program, the details of which are given below.

Your program must receive an integer or a decimal number each time with the input command from the user. This process should continue until the user enters -1 as data. When your program terminates, it should print the following results on the screen.

a-The arithmetic average of the entered positive decimal numbers,
b- The harmonic mean of the negative odd integers entered,
c- The geometric mean of the entered positive even integers,
d- The largest negative odd integer entered,
e- The smallest decimal number entered,
f- Whether the largest number entered is an integer.

Indicate which type of loop would be more appropriate to use in solving this problem (with the reason) as a comment line at the top of your program.


Question 3:

Write a MATLAB program that randomly flips a coin to the computer as many as the input command, a positive integer from the user via the keyboard. When your program ends, an output like the following
should produce:

A total of 5 coins were flipped.
Number of heads: 1 and percentage in total shots: 20%
Number of posts: 4 and percentage in total shots: 80%

Indicate which type of loop would be more appropriate to use in solving this problem (with the reason) as a comment line at the top of your program.

Question 4:

Write a MATLAB program that finds the factorial of a positive integer x, which is not divisible by 5, which is less than itself and the nearest even number neighbor, which the user provides via the keyboard with the input command.

(You can assume that it is guaranteed that x is not divisible by 5.)

Question 5:

A new employee is given a bonus of 1% of his salary every month.

Every 12 months, this worker is given a 10% salary increase. Write a MATLAB program that learns how many months a worker has worked at the workplace, by using the input command, from the user, and finds out what percentage of his first salary as a bonus during his working time, and prints it on the screen.
